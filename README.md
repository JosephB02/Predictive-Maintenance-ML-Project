# Predictive-Maintenance-ML-Project
This project demonstrates how to transition a manufacturing facility from Preventative (Fixed-Interval) maintenance to Predictive (Condition-Based) maintenance. By utilizing a synthetic dataset of 10,000 industrial sensor readings, I developed a machine learning model designed to reduce unplanned downtime.
